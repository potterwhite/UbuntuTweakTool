# UbuntuTweakTool

This Repository is from my personal working script for system tweaking.

The original environment is for the BASH in Ubuntu upper than 18.04

Actually after i met dockerfile and docker compose yaml, i was been shocked and i am really into it.

So i wrote and improved this script internally everytime i need to re-install ubuntu for my development pc.

Invite you to have as many as ideas on this project.
